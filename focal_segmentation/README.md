# Focal Loss for Semantic Segmentation

## Focal Loss
[Focal Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) was proposed by Tsung-Yi Lin et al. in order to improve one-stage object detector.
This loss down-weight the loss value of well classified targets.
So, this loss allow to detector learn from the hard-example well.

This loss has potential for expansion into other task such as classification or semantic segmentation.
In this project, I apply the focal loss to multi-class semantic segmentation.
